One of our specialties at Alaska Tour & Travel is arranging custom land tour packages that connect with Alaska cruises. Passengers taking northbound 7-day Gulf of Alaska cruises from Vancouver, BC generally disembark in Seward or Whittier and begin their post cruise land tours, flying home from either Anchorage or Fairbanks. All of our independent Alaska post cruise tours depart daily during the summer so they connect with all major Alaska cruise lines that disembark in Seward or Whittier. We also have escorted tours and meet up with many cruise arrivals with minor adjustments.

Please note we offer numerous rail and motorcoach cruise transfer options between Anchorage and both Whittier and Seward so nearly all of our packages that start in Anchorage can also be modified to connect with cruises arriving in either Whittier or Seward.

Below you will find some of our most popular Alaska post cruise vacation packages. Click on a package to see photos, a detailed itinerary and pricing information. We offer over 300 different Alaska vacation base packages, so to see more options please use our Alaska Trip Finder, give us a call at 800-208-0200 or contact us online with any questions. If you prefer you can fill out a vacation package request form and we will send you a no obligation quote for the vacation package we think is just right for you. Remember, we can modify any package to meet your exact needs and budget or we can build you a vacation package from scratch.
